title: "Automatic Telescope Pt 3: 3D Printer!"

I recently had a birthday, and my wonderful girlfriend gave me a game-changing gift:
a [FlashForge Finder 3D printer](https://www.jaycar.com.au/flashforge-finder-3d-printer/p/TL4220)!
Yeh she's pretty great hey (and so is my girlfriend üòÜ).

This has opened up a world of possibilities for the Automatic Telescope Project -
I knew I couldn't build the thing using [beer cans and pencils](/2020/03/19/automatic-telescope-compass-and-stepper.html) for much longer, and now I can build it however I want!

I did a few test prints to see how the printer worked (I've never used a 3D printer before):

After I had the printer working I did some quick research into drawing tools/software so I could
start creating my own 3D objects, and landed on [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/).
FreeCAD is Open Source, which I'm a huge fan of, and which also means that it is free - so it fits my budget well üòÅ.
It's also pretty easy to learn, doubly so since there are a tonne of YouTube tutorials available.

Once I had the basics of using the *Part Tool* in FreeCAD down, I decided my first custom design would be a
mount for the stepper motor of the Beer Can prototype.
I have been just blutak-ing the stepper motor to the table for the time being, so a proper mount will be handy.

Here's the 3D printed mount:

Unfortunately the mount isn't very strong - I printed the legs at the wrong angle and they aren't thick enough.
That's OK though as the design will need to change anyway: I have ordered a bigger and better stepper motor,
along with some additional parts. More on that in the next post!
