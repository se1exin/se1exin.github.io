# Hello reader.

For years I've been hacking away on hardware and software projects, and it's about time I started documenting some stuff.
Being a huge fan of open source and it's ideals, what better to make it all public as well in case others hacking away out there might find something interesting or useful.

This site is pretty basic at the moment - just using the default minima Jekyll theme. Promise to take some time to make it look better another day ;)


> What is/why the name 'selexin'? It's just the name of a character from one of my favourite books - 'Contest' by Matthew Reilly. Deal with it.
